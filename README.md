# How to Use

To use this custom theme for the PSVue app, you must first launch PSVue on your PS4.

Once the application is running, connect to your PS4 using an FTP client and navigate to the following directory:

```
/mnt/sandbox/CUSA00960_000/download0
```

Drag and drop the file from this repository into that folder, replacing the existing file if necessary.

After the transfer is complete, simply restart the application.

The theme will remain active permanently, unless you delete the app or replace the `download0.dat` file.
